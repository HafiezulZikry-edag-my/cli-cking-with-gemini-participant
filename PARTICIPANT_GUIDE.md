# CLI-cking with Gemini: Participant Guide

## Welcome to the Dashboard Crisis Challenge!

In this workshop, you'll be playing the role of a senior developer who has been called in to fix a critical production issue. The company's user dashboard is in a state of crisis: it's slow, buggy, and full of security holes.

Your mission is to use your Gemini CLI skills to systematically investigate and identify the root causes of the problems.

## The Challenges

This workshop is divided into three main challenges:

### 1. The Security Meltdown

**The Mission**: Investigate and identify the numerous security vulnerabilities in the dashboard.

**The Code**: The buggy code for this challenge is located in `workshop/src/app/components/BrokenComponent.tsx` and `workshop/src/app/components/SecurityDashboard.tsx`.

**Your Task**:
*   Use `sequential-thinking` to break down the security issues.
*   Use `context7` to research any vulnerabilities you find.
*   Identify the different types of security problems: data exposure, injection vulnerabilities, access control issues, etc.

### 2. The Performance Bottleneck

**The Mission**: Identify the performance issues that are making the dashboard slow and unresponsive.

**The Code**: The poorly performing code is in `workshop/src/app/components/PoorlyWrittenComponent.tsx`.

**Your Task**:
*   Use `sequential-thinking` to analyze the code and identify performance anti-patterns.
*   Use `context7` to research best practices for React performance optimization.
*   Identify issues like unnecessary re-renders, expensive calculations, and inefficient list rendering.

### 3. The Documentation Cleanup

**The Mission**: Help clean up the workshop's documentation by removing outdated and unnecessary files.

**Your Task**:
*   Review the markdown files in the `docs` directory.
*   Decide which files are no longer needed.
*   Help create a new, consolidated guide for future participants.

## How to Approach the Challenges

*   **Be systematic**: Don't just dive into the code and start making random changes. Use a methodical approach to your investigation.
*   **Use your tools**: Gemini CLI is your primary weapon in this challenge. Use it to analyze the code, research solutions, and understand the system.
*   **Think like a detective**: Your job is to find the clues, connect the dots, and uncover the root causes of the problems.

Good luck, and happy debugging!
