## 🛠️ Your Tools

- **sequential-thinking**: Break complex problems into systematic analysis steps
- **context7**: Research authoritative technical information and best practices
- **gemini-cli**: Your primary investigation tool

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **gemini-cli** with sequential-thinking and context7 MCP tools configured
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **VS Code** (recommended)

### Setup
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Begin your investigation**:
   Open http://localhost:3000 and navigate to `/dashboard`

4. **Test your tools**:
   ```bash
   gemini "use sequential-thinking to plan my investigation approach"
   gemini "use context7 to research best practices for code investigation"
   ```

## 🔍 Investigation Methodology

### Start with Sequential-Thinking
- Break down complex problems systematically
- Plan your investigation approach
- Analyze symptoms before jumping to solutions

### Use Context7 for Research
- Research unfamiliar technologies or vulnerabilities

- Understand the root causes
- Document your findings as you go

## 🧪 Verification

Verify your work with automated tests:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:bugs     # Run verification tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your investigation is complete when:
- All automated tests pass
- You understand the root causes of the issues
- You can explain your methodology and findings
- The dashboard functions properly and securely

## 💡 Investigation Tips

- **Think like a detective**: Look for clues and patterns
- **Research before acting**: Use context7 to understand before fixing
- **Be systematic**: Use sequential-thinking to stay organized
- **Focus on understanding**: The journey of investigation is as important as the destination
